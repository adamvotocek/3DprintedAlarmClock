# 3D Printed Arduino Alarm Clock
This is a an alarm clock made from an Arduino Nano, a DS3231 real time clock module, a 7 segment TM1637 display, some buttons, a green LED and a piezo buzzer. The casing is 3d printable.

The code is a mess. I wanted to complete the project before christmass so I used some code from a 2 year old project of mine. 

## Putting it together
The final prototype on a breadboard:

I moved the buttons, the buzzer and the LED onto a protoboard. I made a mistake by choosing a single-sided board so the soldering is a mess.
The front of the control board. I drilled the three remaining holes later:

The back of the control board:

The 3D model in Fusion360. The project and exported meshes can be found in the "3d models" folder.

After 3D printing the casing, I put it all together with the help of some nuts, bolts and hot glue. This is how it looks:
